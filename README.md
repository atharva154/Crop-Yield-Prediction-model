# 🌾 Smart Crop Recommendation & Fertilizer Suggestion ML Model

This Jupyter Notebook presents a **Machine Learning-based solution** to predict suitable **alternate crops**, estimate their **potential yield**, and provide **fertilizer recommendations** based on key environmental and agricultural factors.

The model is designed to aid **farmers, agricultural advisors, and agri-tech platforms** in making informed and sustainable crop planning decisions.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Predicts the most suitable alternate crop for a given region
- 📈 Estimates expected yield based on past trends and environmental conditions
- 🌱 Recommends appropriate fertilizers based on soil and crop type
- 🧠 Supports multiple ML algorithms for performance comparison

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Algorithms

- **Language & Environment**: Python, Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – Data manipulation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualization
